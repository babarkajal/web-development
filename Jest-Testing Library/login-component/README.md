### Jest

1. Write a unit test for the react component

    Before writing an actual unit test, letâ€™s understand the general structure of a test block:

    1. A test is usually written in a test block.
    2. Inside the test block, the first thing we do is to render the component that we want to test.
    3. Select the elements that we want to interact with
    4. Interact with those elements
    5. Assert that the results are as expected.
