## Promises in JS:

### In a Nutshell:

- We can take literal meaning promise over here. We promise something to someone, that I'll do like this. Either we able to do it otherwise we will fail
- Same javascript's promise is, it has will either fail or pass
- It has three stages
    1. pending: until it get's completed
    2. rejected
    3. fullfilled

- Promise allow use to attach callback instead of sending them.
