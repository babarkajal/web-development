                <h1>Computer</h1>
                <p id="first">A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. </p>
                <p id ="second"> A computer system is a "complete" computer that includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation. This term may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.</p>

                <h2>SuperComputer</h2>
                <p class='third'>Supercomputers play an important role in the field of computational science, and are used for a wide range of computationally intensive tasks in various fields, including quantum mechanics, weather forecasting, climate research, oil and gas exploration, molecular modeling (computing the structures and properties of chemical compounds, biological macromolecules, polymers, and crystals), and physical simulations (such as simulations of the early moments of the universe, airplane and spacecraft aerodynamics, the detonation of nuclear weapons, and nuclear fusion). They have been essential in the field of cryptanalysis.</p>

                <h3>MiniComputer</h3>
                <p id='fourth'>A minicomputer is a type of computer that possesses most of the features and capabilities of a large computer but is smaller in physical size.A minicomputer fills the space between the mainframe and microcomputer, and is smaller than the former but larger than the latter. Minicomputers are mainly used as small or mid-range servers operating business and scientific applications. However, the use of the term minicomputer has diminished and has merged with servers.</p>

                <h4>Personal Computer</h4>
                <p>A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. Personal computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user, rather than by a computer expert or technician.</p>
